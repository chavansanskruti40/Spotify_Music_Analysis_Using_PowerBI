   - **Number of Tracks Card:** A card visual showing the total number of tracks included in the dataset.
   - **Average Streams Card:** A card visual displaying the average number of streams per track, highlighting the overall performance.

2. **Temporal Analysis:**
   - **Line Chart for Streams by Release Date:** This visual shows the trend of the number of streams over time, highlighting key periods of popularity from 1940 to 2020.
   - **Bar Chart for Tracks and Streams by Month:** A bar chart visualizing the number of tracks released and their average streams per month, helping to identify seasonal trends and monthly performance.

3. **Daily Streams:**
   - **Column Chart for Daily Patterns:** A column chart breaking down the number of streams by day of the week, providing insights into daily listening habits and peak streaming days.

### Final Insights

Creating this interactive dashboard was an enriching experience that honed my skills in data visualization, data analysis, and Power BI. The use of various visuals not only makes the data more engaging but also allows for a deeper understanding of Spotify's vast music landscape. I look forward to applying these skills to more projects and exploring new ways to turn data into actionable insights.
